To create a README document for your portal solution, I'll need to structure it in a way that provides clear instructions and explanations. Below is an example of how you can format your README file:

# Portal Solution README

## Overview
This portal solution is designed to provide a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionalities, custom components, and seamless interaction. The application leverages **React**, **DND (react-beautiful-dnd)**, and other modern libraries to achieve an interactive and responsive design.

## Features
- **Custom Node Components**: Customizable nodes with editable fields.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Implemented using `react-beautiful-dnd` to reorder fields dynamically within nodes.
- **State Management**: Uses `useState` and `useCallback` hooks for managing component states efficiently.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Conditional rendering for browser-specific behavior using `isBrowser` checks.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **react-beautiful-dnd**: For drag-and-drop features.
- **Lucide-react**: For handling icons and UI enhancements.
- **useReactFlow, useNodeId, useNodes**: React Flow hooks for managing nodes and edges in the canvas.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you can run this project, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **React** (v17.x or later)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/portal-solution.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd portal-solution
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project
To run the project locally, execute the following command:
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```
This will start the development server, and you can view the portal at:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## How to Use

### Custom Node Component
The main component of the portal is `CustomNode`, which renders draggable fields that users can interact with.

1. **Fields**: Users can edit field names and descriptions in the UI. Any changes will trigger the `onChange` function.
2. **Drag and Drop**: Fields within a node can be reordered by dragging them. The `onDragEnd` function handles the reordering logic.

### Preventing Event Propagation
To ensure smooth interaction with drag-and-drop inside nodes while maintaining node-level interactions, event propagation is handled using the `onDragStart` function:
```ts
const onDragStart = useCallback((e: any) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
}, []);
```
This ensures that the drag behavior does not interfere with node-level event handling.

### Drag and Drop Setup
In the `CustomNode` component:
- **DragDropContext** wraps the draggable items.
- **Droppable** identifies the container where draggable items can be placed.
- **Draggable** defines the fields that can be dragged.

Example code:
```jsx
<DragDropContext onDragEnd={onDragEnd}>
  {isBrowser && (
    <Droppable droppableId="droppable">
      {(provided) => (
        <div ref={provided.innerRef} {...provided.droppableProps}>
          {fields.map((field, index) => (
            <Draggable key={field.id} draggableId={field.id} index={index}>
              {(provided) => (
                <div
                  ref={provided.innerRef}
                  {...provided.draggableProps}
                  {...provided.dragHandleProps}
                  className="draggable-field"
                >
                  <input value={field.name} onChange={onChange} />
                </div>
              )}
            </Draggable>
          ))}
          {provided.placeholder}
        </div>
      )}
    </Droppable>
  )}
</DragDropContext>
```

## Known Issues

### Shifting of Fields in Node
When dragging a field inside a node, the field might shift due to node movement on the canvas. This can be solved by synchronizing the node's position with the field's initial position at the time of drag.

## Future Improvements
- **Performance Optimizations**: Improve drag-and-drop performance for larger datasets.
- **Enhanced Node Customization**: Add more custom node fields and validation.
- **Save and Load State**: Implement functionality to save the current node layout and reload it later.
